.mintdotfiles
===

Dotfiles for use with [Linux Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/), running on a 2010-era MacBook Pro. Mint feels brisk and stable on this hardware. [OS X](http://www.apple.com/osx/) might have met its match!

Each dotfile in this directory is reached via symlink from its original directory. Details are given in the blog article [Managing Dotfiles](http://rayhightower.com/blog/2014/04/15/managing-dotfiles/).
